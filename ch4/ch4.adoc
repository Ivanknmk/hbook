Exercises: Find the Mistakes

. `not True && True`
. `not (x == 6) --assuming x is defined in scope`
. Correct
. `["Merry"] > ["Happy"] -- assuming Merry and Happy are NOT in scope`
. `['1', '2', '3'] ++ "look at me!"`

== 4.9 Chapter Exercises

.1.
----
length :: [a] -> Integer
----

.2.

[loweralpha]
. 5
. 3
. 2
. 4

.3.

Will return an error because length's return type Int is not of the typeclass Fractional

.4.
`6 \`div\` length [1,2,3]`

.5.
`Bool`, the expression results in `True`

.6.
`Bool`, the expression results in `False`

.7.

[loweralpha]
. Works. Reduces to `True`
. Will not work. Lists are required to have elements of the same type.
. Works. Reduces to 4.  
. Works. Reduces to `False`
. Will not work. (&&) takes two Bool arguments. 9 is not a Bool.

.8.

[source, haskell]
----
isPalindrome :: (Eq a) => [a] -> Bool
isPalindrome x =
  x == reverse x

λ> isPalindrome "blah"
False
λ> isPalindrome "boob"
True
----

.9.

[source, haskell]
----
myAbs :: Integer -> Integer
myAbs x =
  if x < 0
  then negate x
  else x

λ> myAbs 0
0
λ> myAbs (-5)
5
λ> myAbs 5
5

.10.

[source, haskell]
f :: (a, b) -> (c, d) -> ((b, d), (a, c))
f x y =
  ((snd x, snd y), (fst x, fst y))

=== Correcting Syntax

.1.

[source, haskell]
λ> x = (+)
λ> f xs = w `x` 1 where w = length xs
λ> f "awesome!"
9

.2.

[source, haskell]
λ> \x -> x
\x -> x :: t -> t
λ> (\x -> x) "awesome!"
"awesome!"

.3.

[source, haskell]
λ> f (a, b) = a
λ> f (100, 230)
100

=== Matching the function names to their types

1. c) `Show a => a -> String`
2. b) `Eq a => a -> a -> Bool`
3. a) `(a, b) -> a`
4. d) `(+) :: Num a => a -> a -> a`

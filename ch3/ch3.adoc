= 3. Strings

== 3.4 Top-level versus local definitions

=== Exercises: Scope

. Yes. *_y_* is in scope for *_z_*
. No. *_h_* is undefined and thus not in scope.
. No. The *_d_* in `r = d / 2` is undefined.
. Yes. *_d_* is defined by the `area` function parameter.

== 3.5 Types of concatenation functions

=== Exercises: Syntax Errors

. No. The (++) infix operator needs parentheses to be used as prefix.
. No.
** Multiple characters inside single quotes won't parse.
** The (++) operator works on lists of Chars.
. Yes. `concat` accepts a list of lists as input.

[loweralpha]
. Correct. `concat :: \[[a]] -> [a]`
. Incorrect. Correction: `(++) [1,2,3] [4,5,6]`
. Correct. `(++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]`
. Incorrect. Correction: `"hello" ++ " world!"`
. Incorrect. Correction> `"hello" !! 4`
. Correct. `(!!) :: [a] -> Int -> a`
. Incorrect. Correction: `take 4 "lovely"`
. Correct. `take :: Int -> [a] -> [a]`

=== Building functions

1 a)::
[source, haskell]
λ> "Curry is awesome" ++ "!"
"Curry is awesome!"

b)::
[source, haskell]
λ> take 1 $ drop 4 "Curry is awesome!"
"y"

c)::
[source, haskell]
λ> drop 9 "Curry is awesome!"
"awesome!"

2::
[source, haskell]
----
exclamate :: String -> String
exclamate =
  flip (++) "!"

fifth :: String -> String
fifth =
  take 1 . drop 4

fromTenth :: String -> String
fromTenth =
  drop 9
----

[source, haskell]
λ> exclamate "Curry is awesome"
"Curry is awesome!"
λ> fifth "Curry is awesome!"
"y"
λ> fromTenth "Curry is awesome!"
"awesome!"

3::
[source, haskell]
thirdLetter :: String -> Char
thirdLetter =
  flip (!!) 2

[source, haskell]
λ> thirdLetter "Curry is awesome!"
'r'

4::
[source, haskell]
letterIndex =
  (!!) "Curry is awesome!"

[source, haskell]
λ> letterIndex 3
'r'
λ> letterIndex 0
'C'
λ> letterIndex 5
' '
λ> letterIndex 1000
*** Exception: Prelude.!!: index too large

5::
[source, haskell]
rvrs x =
  drop 9 x ++ (take 4 $ drop 5 x) ++ take 5 x

[source, haskell]
λ> rvrs "Curry is awesome"
"awesome is Curry"
